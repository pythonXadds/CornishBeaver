### CHAPTER 1 - The House





+



The phone was ringing, yet no one was there to answer. The house at the top of the hill was in darkness. Too much had happened there; it had an eerie look about the place, and I for one would never have gone there at all, if I had a choice. But unfortunately,I did not. Strangely, I thought that the phone should be ringing in this old place. I mean, who would want to ring there? Nobody has lived there in twenty years. No, I must be imagining it, yes, that must be it. I mean, I haven't slept in twenty-four hours, the mind often does play tricks when sleep deprived. Using my hand, I wiped the dirt off the window, just enough to see into what was the old foyer. I could see an umbrella stand, still with coats upon the hooks, next to it standing silent were various walking canes, in a basket by the front entrance hall door. I could not really see enough, frustrated, I felt there was nothing for it, I would have no choice but to break-in and have a proper look around. All the while, hearing the distinct voice, in the back of my minds eye, of someone telling me;  " *You know that's not true, it is always wrong to break-in to another's property*"



Ignoring this weird voice's rhetoric, I proceeded to pick up an old red brick that was lying in what was once the walled garden, and quickly, without any hesitation,  to smash the old crusty window. It didn't take much, since the window was already cracked and rotten. (*just like my mind felt at that moment*) The once shiny, daily cleaned glass, shattered into millions of tiny little sharp pieces. It was at that moment that I could feel what was the tiniest little pain in my fingers. I had obviously cut myself in all that haste, I could see the colour of scarlet running down the outside wall, a hearty meal for some, I shouldn't wonder! 

I turned my flashlight on and glanced inside, all was very quiet, save for an owl hooting in a nearby tree, and I could see several Pipistrelle and long-eared bats flying out of the eaves circling around, wanting to drink my blood? no, that is the vampire bats that do that. every now and then, catching an unfortunate moth that had now become its dinner, I pointed my flash-light into the room. My heart was thudding, I could hear my heart pulsing,throbbing in my head. I just kept telling myself: There was nobody here, this house has not been inhabited since the 'happening' twenty years previous. And what is more, Ghosts and the like were merely an invention of the imagination, *at-least, that is what I told myself!*


As I entered that creepy room, the phone again started to ring. I could not help it, I was *so* tempted to answer, to find out *who* it was. But still that nagging voice convinced me to think again. I decided against it. *At any rate, the phone again went silent.* I exited the foyer, and walked into the kitchen, which was dark and damp- a linen sack, which must have once contained potatoes, lied limp, against a kitchen chair. There was an old kettle sitting upon the stove, and many tins and jars upon the dusty spider webbed shelves. Quietly becoming dust, decaying in all that age-old rust. As I looked around the room, trying to take it all in, I was suddenly startled, there lying in a basket, was a skeleton, more to the point; the skeleton was of what once must have been a *very much alive dog!*  It just lay there, *as one would expect*  in a heap, just as everything else did in this place. Why hadn't he been rescued? *I knew the dog was a he, because he was still wearing a collar, with the name Gus inscribed upon it.* Well, I don't suppose I need to worry about all that now, I mean to say, it's dead, and no one has ever been bitten by an old dead Dog. As I spoke those words aloud to myself, I could again hear that strange voice  questioning the very words as I spoke them. Furthermore, remembering those terrible zombie stories one read as a child only helped fuel my already over-active imagination. It's a fact that has always perturbed me, about the human mind, how the mind tries to place some doubt into one's brain,about the very thoughts that the mind itself placed there in the first place, even when one knows using logic alone, that it simply can't be true, the inner voice says different. 

I left the kitchen behind and decided to have a curious nose upstairs to take a look in the bedrooms. Maybe I will find what I am looking for there? so, I walked up the very long and steep staircase, covered in thick red patterned carpet, I felt my arm  brush against something rather cold, and hard. It made me jump slightly, until I realised it was merely a marble figure, of some mythological female staring at all who dared to climb these long stairs, with a serious look upon her face. I almost felt as if she were only asleep, and at any moment she might awaken from her slumber, and ask why I am in her house. I walked round a short bend, then came upon some stuffed creature, a bear I think, poor thing I thought. Finally coming upon some rooms though they weren't the bedrooms, these were a kind of long passage, which had a series of small empty rooms, that were once lit by candlelight. the walls were covered in black damp, and cobwebs had formed a curtain in one corner of the hall. Eventually passing some busts and portraits of some very austere looking people, I spotted an open door, it led to the master bedroom, only there was no bed in it. Merely; oh, My word. Is that what I think it is?


###  CHAPTER 2 -Exploration



++



Unfortunately for me it was! There right in front of me, was a coffin. It was placed in the spot where the bed ought to have been, I walked over to it, half expecting to find someone in it, but no, alas, it was quite empty. The coffin was lined with a luscious purple velvet and I could see there, placed at the pillow end, a single gloriously blood red rose. Stranger still, it was a fresh red rose! 
Now this has created for me a problem, firstly. No one was supposed to have been in here over the past twenty-years. secondly; Why was this coffin here at all? The voice in my head didn't come, I was completely clueless, I don't know why I suddenly had the desire  to hear that imaginary voice anyhow, perhaps it was better to have that creepy voice as company, after-all, than face up to the reality that is at this very moment about to stare me in my very confused face?

I left the bedroom behind, not forgetting to look over my shoulder as I went, since I was still understandably feeling somewhat spooked by the strange happenings in what feels like what's becoming a big house of horrors!I walked across the corridor, down two steps and entered what was another bedroom, this time there was a bed in the room, the room contained nothing much at all, except a few old books and some left-over candle wax, that had dried all over the bedside table. Feeling somewhat disappointed, with the lack of answers to my questions, I decided to explore the house some more. I came to what appeared to be a hole in the wall, half covered by a velvet curtain. I must admit I did hesitate slightly at the sight of this dark narrow space, I've never liked enclosed spaces. There was a narrow, circular flight of stairs, that looked as if they were designed for pixies, as I walked up the spiral staircase, I realised that I must be going up to the tower, there were tiny slits in the walls, I could get a glimpse at the dark starry sky, sandwiched between two slices of granite bread. As I continued walking up to the room of mystery, I finally got to the entrance of this room, when I entered, I found a stark sight; it was a chapel-like room, only, unlike a Christian chapel, which would contain busts of saints etc. This chapel had busts of what looked to me like depictions of medieval daemons and a high altar, the previous owner of this place, was certainly strange indeed. upon the altar was a candelabra and several stuffed animals, mainly corvids. The most frightful of all was that of a raven, it looked as if it had been literally frightened to death, perched there with a silver coloured dagger stuck in it's dark evil looking neck. I found my knees involuntarily getting heavier and heavier, until I could no longer stand, and fell firstly down onto my knees, then onto my back, it was then that I passed out. I don't know for how long exactly, all I know is that it felt like a lifetime, everything started moving in slow-motion, and I a whirlwind of giddiness. 

This whole affair was beginning to unnerve me somewhat. What kind freaky house is this? After sitting upon the chapel floor for several minutes,just what I was thinking about in those moments, is still to this very day,a complete mystery. All I do know, is that I would never be quite the same person ever again. I felt the most terrific needed to eat. I was getting this hunger for something, the urge was getting very intense, unbearably so. I decided to go back down to the kitchen on the off-chance that I may have found some morsel of food, to satisfy my appetite.



	

### Chapter 3 - Rats



+++



I entered the kitchen, looking around to see if I could find anything remotely resembling food. I couldn't find a thing. The dog was not a possibility, I thought to myself, it's just a pile of bones, and I didn't Much of an appetite for it anyhow. The stuffed animals were certainly not an option, but then, neither was leaving this house. I had too many questions that needed answering and too much curiosity. As that wise old saying goes, *pity I ignored*: "Curiosity killed the cat" I saw out of the corner of my eye, the shadowy silhouette of a rat, it was nibbling at the ends of an old sack, suddenly before I had any time to think - I had swiftly caught the rat and bit into it with such force,sucking all the while  the blood out of it, until it became quite limp/lifeless, and at that point my thirst was well and truly quenched. 

It was in that moment, that  I felt more wonderful than I had felt in a long while, invigorated and incredibly energised. Then shame and confusion set in. Why had I just done that? It was only a rat, *I kept telling myself,* However this didn't seem to entirely remove my desire for warm blood.
no, on reflection it wasn't that which worried me, it was the fact that I seemed very skilled at the kill, and what's worse; I seemed to really like, no; love the taste of that warm, fresh blood. I could feel myself becoming somewhat thirsty again, I was very tempted to find another rat. But no,not at the moment, I had to continue my search! 

I needed answers. So  I went back to the chapel room, it looked very much the same as the last time I saw it, Creepy and eerily quiet. I spent a while looking at the various objects in the room, my eye was especially focused upon the grotesque statues, *which seem to be everywhere in this house.* I could see  'it' was not representative of anything remotely good. These never transient, always dead  carved pieces of stone, gave one a chill, the way they seemed to keep looking at me, with those non-changing glass eyes, I felt almost as if they were following me around the room. Maybe someone was? 

As I went over to what I will call the altar, there didn't appear to be anything of great interest. Feeling somewhat drowsy, I decided it was a good moment to take a short nap. Oh how foolish I was!  I regretted taking that nap.  I had slept for many more hours than I ever intended, and when I awoke, the chapel was lit with candles. Who had lit them?  There were candles all around me.  I still lying upon the hard stone- floor. I should have been most grateful for the extra light, for the night had arrived. If only it weren't for the fact I didn't light them, so who did, was it me? I asked the voice, but as expected  I got no reply, everything was deadly silent, save for the sound of my breath getting faster and faster with every inhalation of air. 

So many strange things seemed to happen in this house, that I sort of became desensitised to the whole thing. I just ignored the eeriness of it all, one becomes quite the *dab hand* at blanking things one doesn't wish to think about. In my continued curiosity, I continued to look around. Little did I realise, there were eyes gazing intently upon me, it was whilst desperately craving food, or more to the point; some blood, that a thought came upon me.
No, I thought to myself, that can't be right, I'm barking up the same wrong tree that dog once had. And look what happened to him! that strange voice was mine, it couldn't be anyone else's,
It was whilst mastering the art of absolutely shitting myself, that I noticed a book upon the altar that hadn't been there previously. I went over and touched it, with my sweaty hands, to make certain it was real, I was getting scared, who had put that book there? I picked it up, and, could not believe my eyes, there embossed upon the front covers were the initials: *F. H. Wells*. 
 

These were my initials.


… …. … …. 


 I dropped the book on the floor, and went in search of blood.  I could not help it, I could no longer resist, my need for blood was becoming so strong that It seemed to override my fears. Maybe, I thought, if I had my  thirst satisfied, I would be much more able to think things through a little more clearly. though I couldn't imagine how.  I went into the remnants of the kitchen and tried to see if I could find another mangy rat, but unfortunately, I couldn't find a single one. There was, I decided, nothing for it, I would have to go outside in the hope that I could find some prey to satisfy my now intense cravings. Outside, there was a full moon on this particular night, I could hear the distant sound of an owl, obviously, like myself, out looking for food. It was a beautiful moon, I stared up at it for a moment wishing I was there instead of here. I bet it would be ever so peaceful there. Forgetting the lack of gravity and life. I walked further  into the much overgrown grounds, being guided by the moonlight. yet still there was no sign of life. I couldn't find a single pesky morsel to satisfy my thirst.  To go into the woodland that was just beyond the abandoned grounds seemed like the only option to me. The trees looked like an army of trunks, there were no leaves on the trees, since winter was at work and everything was bare and naked. This only added to my problem, since most of the woodland animals would be hibernating this time of year. 

Finally I came across a small farm that was obviously like everything else in this area; devastated save for a few cattle.  I didn't really question at that moment why there were cattle at an abandoned farmstead. Instead I  remarked to myself,  no one would notice if I were to kill one of them, to get some blood.  It seemed like a good idea at the time.
 I entered a barn that had a roof on one half of it, the rest of the roof had long ago fallen in. There were only  three cows, and they didn't look awfully healthy. The one cow looked at me with an evil look in its eye. I say eye, because it only had one! But, as I was thinking at the time, 'beggars can't be choosers.'  There I was, just readying myself  to bite into the cow's  stiff neck, when a figure could be seen in the reflection of the cow's eye . I froze and so had the cow, it was now stone dead!



	

### Chapter 4 - The mysterious figure



++++



There was a loud THUD! as the cow fell to the ground, the figure didn't speak at first, he just stood there in silence watching me, with a small grin upon his face.  It wasn't a particularly pleasant grin, it was mischievous and I didn't feel at all at ease. I must confess, I did consider the possibility of drinking his blood instead of the now dead cows. I thought, one less human in the world wouldn't do the earth any harm whatsoever.  I was thinking this as I stood quaking in my shoes, trying to maintain some composure.


Unfortunately,
he spoke, and I realised it would be folly to try and kill him,  especially after what he later told me. He first introduced himself as 'the one without a name' which I thought odd, everyone has a name don't they? He explained ofcourse, that had he told me his name, I would be hounded to the end of the earth, and would probably not be left alone until I had been sent to a world of eternal fire. I asked him if he was god. He laughed, and said; if he were then I would have been in even worse problems than I currently was. He explained that he would tell me more about himself at some point in the future, but that the main reason he had come to me, was to warn me to be very careful in that house, and that he couldn't tell me at the present
moment any more than that - only that I was in grave danger, and that if he were me (which he isn't) he would get as far away from that place as he possibly could. I explained that there was no other way I could work out who I was. I told him of my memory loss, and the fact that I had a very strong urge to explore that house, even though I did not know why.
 He remarked that this was not surprising, that this house has always had power over people. It was a very magical house. I told him about the journal and about all the strange occurrences that have happened in this old house. He simply kept repeating the words; leave If you value your life.


What was it he was scared of? Had he had a bad experience himself in that house?  I spoke to him of my incessant hunger and my new-found taste for blood.

He told me impatiently, this was a perfectly normal impulse and need, and that I must embrace my inner nature and stop seeking to escape from who I was always destined to be. I, he said, always have and always would be a vampire, it was pointless trying to ignore this fact or my urges, since Vampirism will always win. It's a simple fact of nature. He then, after saying these things, suddenly vanished.

 I looked around, thinking perhaps I had imagined it.
but Worryingly I knew I hadn't. I changed my mind about killing the cow, she was pregnant and I didn't want to kill an animal expecting.

So, I decided to enter the farm house and take the blood of

whomever I should come across in the house. I wasn't doing this

to kill, I was doing this because if I didn't, I would probably

die. I was beginning to feel very weak. And to be honest I cared

little for the taste of rats, I cared even less about humans.

They had never done anything nice for me.





### Chapter 5 - The Farmhouse and what I found there



+++++



I entered the farmhouse through the window, since it was wide

open, almost beckoning me to enter. I never understood why some

people would leave their windows open so wide, I mean, it's

surely asking for trouble. I stepped into the house and could

see that this house was very uncared for, the cows in the

broken-down barn outside, seemed more cared for than this old

house.  I walked around trying to see if there was anyone at

home, and could see that there was no one downstairs, obviously

the owner had gone to bed, which is perfectly normal at this

time of night. There was a fire burning in the hearth, it was a

very welcome sight, since it was getting somewhat parky outside,

and I had spent a long time wandering around, in the cold

evening air. I sat in front of the fire, thinking about the

conversation I had with that strange fellow, a short whirl ago.

Apparently, I am a vampire? This would explain my lust for

blood. Though, I don't remember ever having the desire to drink

human blood, until I stepped inside that old house. One moment I

was a man, suffering with memory loss, the next I am having all

kinds of strange experiences and thoughts and I thought it was

hunger that forced me to take the life of those rats, yet I so

enjoyed the taste of the blood. Maybe I am a vampire, though I

still find this hard to believe.  That chap seemed to know a lot

more about everything, than he was willing to divulge to me. I

so wanted some answers, yet he didn't really give me any, he has

just given me lots more questions instead. I stood up, went

towards the small flight of stairs, not knowing exactly what I

would find when I got to my destination. All I knew was that I

needed to gain my strength back, and regrettably, the only way

to achieve this was to take a life, in order to sustain mine. I

walked towards the bedroom, and there in the place of a bed was

a coffin, I walked over to it, and there lying in the coffin

asleep, was the gentleman I had met only a short while before.

He immediately awoke, and said, in a grand yet creepy manner: 'I

thought You were never coming' 'You were expecting me?' I asked.

'Of-course I was', he replied. 'I always know when someone is

going to call, even before the person knows the fact themselves'

Ã...  'Why is it, that although I can always know who is coming, but

can never seem to predict the actual time, the person is going

to arrive?' 'I think it's because people never seem to stick to

plans, always chopping and changing'  I really was very

confused, I couldn't understand why this person couldn't have

just invited me into his home, rather than playing this

theatrical escapade. I am not a huge fan of surprises, I

thought. 'Not many are' the gent remarked. 'I can read people's

thoughts, something that is often both a blessing and a curse'

'I'm sure it is' I dryly replied, I really wasn't too sure about

this fellow. He seemed very tricky and I somehow, felt that he

was not entirely who he seemed.  'Do join me in a little sport'

the gent said; 'I have a perfect specimen of manhood, right here

in my house, and I'm sure You would love to share his blood with

me' 'Though, he will probably not thank us for it on the morrow,

when he realises he is forever destined to be a vampire, and to

live his life forever in darkness' 'How come, If I'm a vampire,

as You say, that I am able to be in the daylight, without harm

coming to me?' I asked. 'That's a myth, old chap' Said the Gent.

'Vampires were never not capable of being in the sunlight, we

merely chose to live the nocturnal lifestyle, because it suits

us, also it doesn't lead to impertinent questions from the human

race.'  This was all very interesting, I thought, however, how

much longer was I expected to listen to all these riddles,

without getting any actual answers?  'All in good time, the

gentleman replied' reading my thoughts and replying to them,

which I thought was somewhat rude and impertinent.  'I will tell

You all you need to know, and probably lots more besides, you

will, I imagine would wish you didn't know. But come, we must

eat!'





	

### Chapter 6 - A strange meal



++++++





This was a very strange experience indeed. According to the old 

chap, I am a vampire, which I might be, but since I can't



remember, it doesn't really make much difference to me anyhow. 

It's a odd thing, when one likes, no; needs blood, in order to

feel normal, and in control of ones urges.  however, I have

always preferred to only drink of the blood of animals, since.

though I haven't been treated all that well by humans, I had

until recently considered myself one. And to be perfectly frank,

I don't really have any desire to be a vampire. They scare me,

at least my present host, does. He's too unpredictable, dare I

even say; weird? There's something not quite right about him,

and I don't really want to know what that is.  I so want to get

back to that house, I feel I have some kind of connection to

that awful place, though my memory won't allow me to know what.

I thought this gent would tell me something, but all he seems to

do is witter and tell those uninteresting stories. I suppose you

are curious as to what happens next. I will stop talking now,

and get back to the story.



The old gentleman led me into a room, where there was a group of

people all looking pretty intoxicated with alcohol. I didn't  

seem to understand what they were doing here. All I did know,

was that I didn't like this at all. The old gentleman had a

sneaky look upon his face, and I knew he was up to something. He

grinned at me, and said: "aren't these people just delicious. I

always prefer to entertain intelligent guests. As he said this,

I looked at the people in the room, whom seemed quite oblivious

to what I feared was going to happen. The old gent, asked me if

I was prepared for a feast, and I am ashamed to admit, I

actually was kind tempted. But I was determined not to stoop to

such levels. I mean, only a short while ago I was breaking in to

that old house, and I had discovered some strange things. Now I

have developed a new taste for blood, and I am finding it harder

and harder to resist. I don't know where these desires came

from, all I know is that I am unable to resist the smell and

sight of blood. Many humans have this understandable fear of

blood. This is not surprising, since seeing blood i usually a

sign of death, illness or pain. However, it is hard to explain,

how to  me, I don't feel those feelings at all. It is one of

those situations where I know I ought to not be doing something,

yet, I can't help myself. This is one occasion where instincts

get the better of me. I was incredibly hungry and feared I

would not last much longer if I didn't get some blood soon. I

believe  I will probably get my wish!

The people in the room seemed to be having a wonderful time.

They were drinking, laughing and one could see that they

seriously believed that this was merely a dinner party, and I

over-heard one of the men saying to his companion, that the old

man was obviously a gullible fool, and that they must take all

they can off him. Since he's obviously very trusting, to allow

all of us to be in his house, despite the fact that he doesn't

even know us.

As he said that to his friend, I thought: 'that's what he

thinks' this old gent is not stupid, or gullible. Rather, he is

a cunning and crafty demon, who actually lured them into his

house, in order to kill them. I know he most unlikely to

transform them into vampires, since I know, based on what he

told me earlier today, that he is not in favour of creating

vampires out of humans, i'm quite sure that if he had his/its

way, he would most probably love nothing more than to treat

these humans like cattle. Human farms, whereby he could

sacrifice them at his own will. I don't like to admit it, but I

can't help finding that idea somehow thrilling, though I am

doing all I can to try to stay on the straight and narrow.

By this point the people were getting more and more intoxicated,

they were being given much wine, and they were all starting to

become rather sleepy. The old gent was now licking his lips,

with a kind of relish, I could see that he was probably having

the same inclinations, that I too was having. Since Vampires, I

would imagine all have the same needs. He beckoned me over to

him, and started to whisper into my ear.

"these people won't suffer, you needn't worry. I am a

professional killer, and I will do the kill as swift and

painlessly as possible. Though, I can't promise that they won't

feel something, since having their blood and life force taken

out of them, is not a pleasant experience for them, but one does

learn to enjoy it. I can't help enjoying the sounds the people

make as they are having their very lives taken from them, and

they are by this point totally powerless to do anything about it.  

I didn't like these descriptions at all. He was a horrid old

man. Indeed, it's quite true, one needs to eat. but must one do

so with such evil relish and delight? He grabbed the chap from 

earlier and began to bite into his neck, the lad, who was not all 

that old, perhaps only twenty. Was coming around from his stupor. 

And it seems that he was in a lot of pain, that is, until he took 

his final gasping breath. At least his suffering was finally 

over. The next chap the old gent offered to me, usually  I would 

have refused. But I was so hungry, I had to accept his offer. 

It's a strange thing, but I didn't feel a single ounce of guilt 

at the time, it is only now in retrospect, that I am beginning to 

feel guilt about what I had done.  I didn't feel all that bad, 

drinking the blood of the chap. But I did feel differently when 

It came to the woman, who looked far too beautiful to kill. I 

don't know if that is sexist, but that's how it is. I decided not 

to kill her, though I wasn't going to leave her as she was eithÃ‚ ­

er. But to help her transition, and become a vampire like me. I 

couldn't leave her as a human, that would be too awkward. Could 

you imagine, her being human, whilst I, a newly discovered vamÃ‚ ­

pire, drinking blood and having to kill for a living, I somehow 

doubt that she would accept that. I was tired of being alone and 

I wanted someone to keep me company. I was actually becoming a 

new person, may be not in the manner that I expected, but that is

life I suppose. Anyway, back to the narrative:



I was just about to bite into her neck and share some of my

saliva with her (this is the only way to turn one into a

vampire, a vampire must share his saliva) or so the old gent had

told me earlier. When the old gent suddenly stopped me, and told

me that If I must do the dreaded thing, and turn a disgusting

human into one of our kind, there is a protocol and code so to

speak, and one must obey it. I asked him what this 'protocol'

was, and he went on to tell me.

He told me that all vampires must first understand three basic

points, these are: One: a vampire can only make a human a

vampire once every few years, two; If one is turned into a

vampire, then that person belongs to the person who created

them. They will forever have to serve under the lead vampire and

only if the head of all vampires has some use for the

aforementioned vampire, then the owner must give the person over

to him or her. The new vampire is a second class vampire and

will never be considered an equal to first degree vampires, and

they must always give their master the first bite of any chosen

victim.

Basicly, the rules are very stringent, and the old gent said,

that he had once had a companion, but it all went wrong, when he

realised that he didn't like this person any more and yet, there

was no way of killing her. Since these second degree vampires

are forever their owners sole responsibility. He said that he

only managed to get rid of her in the end, by getting the great

high vampire to promote her. Since he can do that at his own disÃ‚ ­

cretion.

It all sounded very compplicated to me. But I had made up my

mind, I wanted her, and was going to have her. I was also told

that there was no guarantee that she would like me at all. since

no vampire is expected to 'like' anyone or thing. This was the

one right the second degree vampire had.I as usual, put caution  

Ãƒâ" :   F7                      

Ã...  to the wind and proceeded to bite into her beautiful neck, which

was soft and she smelled really lovely. I drunk a lot of her 

blood, and was almost tempted to finish her off, the temptation 

to drink all of her blood was as always great. But this was part 

of the great test. Can I resisit my natural urges and leave just 

enough blood in her, so that I can transfer my saliva. This is 

what I did. It seemed to me, as if she dided, then was ressurectÃ‚ ­

ed and came back to life again. For some time she didn't stir, 

and I saw absolutely no sign of breath. Then, after several 

minutes, I heard her gasp, her chest was heaving heavily and I 

really for a minute thought that I had failed in what I was 

trying to do. However, after a while she came round looked at me, 

and my eyes became transfixed and I couldn't take my eyes off 

her. The old chap had to drag me away from her. He told me that I

mustn't be too close to her at the present moment, since it

could cause a severe reaction, and I might end up giving my soul

up to her, which would then put me under permanant servitude to 

her. 

A vampire's soul is in the dark eyes, which is a gateway to 

another world. A very dangerous and dark place. This is the real 

reason vampires never give people eye-contact and also why they 

tend to go out only by night. Vampires do not like the daylight, 

because it gives others' the opppertunity to look into their 

eyes, putting them at a great disadvadvantage and could possibly 

even lead to something horrific; one actually developing compasÃ‚ ­

sion for those whom the world calls humans. 

I couldn't help but think, whilst looking at her, that perhaps I 

had changed a perfectly beautiful creature, into a monster. 

She would now have to spend an eternity, serving me, even if she 

doesn't want to, and she's also going to have to spend the rest 

of her days drinking blood, and what's worse; killing people in 

order to do this. It really is a quite terrifying prospect.

I decided to take the old chaps advice and make way back to the 

old house, he told me, that she would shortly follow, since it 

was now here life's mission to serve me. And that I would no 

longer be alone, I would in fact be able to enjoy "perfect and 

permanent companionship" he said, in a somewhat sarcastic tone.
