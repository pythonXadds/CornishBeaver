# BBC BASIC

I have started learning BBC basic. Which I am really enjoying, so far. I have written a basic program that can add two numbers together. (very basic!) But considering a week ago, I didn't know 
a thing, I think I did pretty well. 

*as a side-note*: I am now going to write my blog entirely in WordStar, which so far so good, has been a rather enjoyable and distraction-free way of writing.
