# It’s been a very sad day.

Today has not been the best of days. I don’t usually write about personal things on this blog, but i thought this was one ocassion when I think I should.



Today I recieved the sad news that my dear friend Jason had suffered a major heart attack on new years eve, and **very** sadly, passed away. 

Dead. 

Kaput.

What can I write about this sad event? nothing much. except to say; 



*J* You are and always be my Soul-pal.
