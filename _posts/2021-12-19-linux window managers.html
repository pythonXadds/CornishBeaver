    <h1>Linux windows managers</h1>
    <br>

    <h3><b>JWM - Joe's window manager:</b></h3>
    <p><br>
      This has always been one of my favourite window managers. It's
      very easy to use, runs really fast. And does everything one could
      need. The only thing I would say is that it doesn't come with a
      autogenerated menu,out of the box, neither does it arrange windows
      in a automatic way. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Jwm is a manual tiling window manager, which means you decide
      where the windows go and how they display. <br>
    </p>
    <p>I have created a <i>.jwmrc </i>config file, which you need to
      place in your <b>./home</b> folder, and the <i>icons </i>needed<i>
      </i>can be added by placing the<i> jwm folder</i> in '<b>usr/share/jwm</b>'
      <br>
    </p>
    in order to get that autogenerated menu, all you need to do is
    follow my <i>.readme </i>file and this will help you to install <b>xdgmenmaker
    </b>which will then give you a dynamic menu that will automatically
    add apps to the menu, without the need to manually configure the
    menu. <br>
