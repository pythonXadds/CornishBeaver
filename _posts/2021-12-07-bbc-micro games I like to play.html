    <h4>Blockbusters' <br>
    </h4>
    One of the games I have been playing recently is <b>Blockbuster's </b>
    Which I think is a fine game if You'd like to test your general
    knowledge. Some of the questions I found rather difficult. This game
    is not one of those easy kids games, it actually asks some really
    good questions. The music brought back some nostalgia for me.
    Hearing that theme tune in 80s synth was a novelty too.<br>
    I rate this game 6/10<br>
