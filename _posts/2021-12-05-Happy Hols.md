# MERRY XMAS!

## Is the internet damaged beyond repair?



I sometimes think that the internet is a hopeless cause. Those days of hobby webmasters and plain text websites seem to be a thing of the past. Only a few of us still use this older technique of running a website. And it still works pretty well. 

The *world wide spider web* that is known as the internet, is now a place of commerce, heavily dominated by Google and Microsoft. Really one could say that the internet **<u>is Google</u>**.

> The internet is Google

What a scary but true thought. The web is no longer a place of innovation, where one can use ones artistic creativity to make a website that uniquely represents *you*.

Search XMAS and you will probably get a whole list of special offers, ads and pop-ups to try and sell you your very own singing Father Christmas. 

No thanks! Baa freakin' humbug dear friends.
