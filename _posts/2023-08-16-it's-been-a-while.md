# It's been a while



I haven't posted anything on this page for quite some time. I have been having a break from the internet and as a consequence not really posted anything here!



I thought I would record a list of my favourite window managers and apps, so that if I ever forget (which I am likely to do) I will have a reference on the interweb to remind me. 

**My favourite wms are:** (in no particular order)

- TWM - Tabbed window manager, a very old minimal wm, but I think it's pretty decent.
- FLVM- I am particularly fond of this wm, I tend to use the original, and have not really bothered using the more modern (haha) flvwm2.
- i3wm Everone (almost) likes this window manager. *wow I actually typed the whole word*
- Window Maker- no space, I don't think? This is a cool mother F.



That concludes my list. Screenshots might follow.
