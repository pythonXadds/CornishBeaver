A couple days ago, I installed Fedora. Never again! Gosh it took me hours to install everything and then I realisef
that many of the applications I needed were not available. So I installed 'Bunsen Labs' and everything went awesomely 
well, until it came to the proprietry drivers. This lead to another head-ache. In the end I just made do with the 
ethernet cable instead.
