â€‹																			![Welcome friends](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pythonXadds/pymd/master/kerop2.gif)

Hello world! and welcome to my slice of cake, My chunk of web, to the world (which is mine) of 'PythonXadds' This blog is a place where I like to write my thoughts about anything, though that's far too liberal a subject matter for any blog/page. Readers like to know exactly what a bog is about, but since I very much doubt I will ever have such a person as a reader, I don't really need a subject. Though; I am going to give a few, whilst we are on the subject. My main interests are: Linux, Open source, Python programming (as my name suggests) and all things computers. Perhaps a little poetry and prose, thrown into the mix, just to add a little interest, for myself. And so it seems, I did write a list of subjects, and though not exhaustive, I wouldn't want to bore myself to death!



If You have any interest in poetry, please visit my WordPress blog, (no one visits) by clicking here: [link] [https://writeradhughes.wordpress.com](https://writeradhughes.wordpress.com/) "blog"
